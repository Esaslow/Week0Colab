Now we could take `sum_1_8`, add 9 and subtract off 1. And that works, but it involves some thinking to make this new idea work with the existing code that we have written.\n",

In the above example, we see exactly what we're doing to sum the numbers 1 through 8. This isn't abstracted at all. So how are we to solve this problem more abstractly?\n",

This can be thought of as given a starting number, 1, and then adding on the next number, 2, to get 3. Then we can repeat this process, taking the next number, 3, and adding it on, giving us 6. We could then continue this process until we reach the final number, 8, and then stop. (This is inherently what we were doing in that single line of Python when we said `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8`, but that implementation is what we call **brittle** - it only works for that specific case and breaks whenever we want to do something even slightly different.)\n",
