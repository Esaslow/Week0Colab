        "This notebook here is meant to get you oriented with one of the tools that we will be using for our pre-class material. The notes and exercises will be built into IPython notebooks (like this one). Before coming to each class, you should work through the materials in the pre-class folder and play around/follow along with the code in those notebooks. You should run the code provided, and additionally modify it to learn what happens when you change certain/different pieces.\n",
        "\n",
        "Effectively learning to program means having your hands-on the keyboard often. It means playing with code, breaking code, reading errors, and reading google. It means banging your head against the keyboard, but getting to revel in that time spent banging your head when you're program finally works. To that end, this notebook here will hopefully give you a taste of that.\n",
        "\n",
        "You might not know exactly what all the lines of code in this notebook do. But, don't worry, because you will know all about these ideas in a week. For now, it's going to be good to get used to your environment and reading and writing some simple Python code. Besides, there's a good chance you'll know what's going on in most of these exercises.\n",
        "\n",
        "You'll start off by type some working code, and playing around with it. Then, we'll walk you through an example of working with some broken code (don't worry, it won't be too bad). Finally, you'll finish up by learning how to move the working code into a script, and you'll run you're very first Python program!\n",

        "For all of the exercises below, we've included the exact number of cells for you to complete the assignment in. However, if you want more to experiment with, at any time you can click the + button in the upper-left hand corner of the notebook, and a new cell will be created below the one that is currently selected. If you would like to delete a cell you've created for experimentation, simply select the cell and click the edit tab at the top of the notebook. Then, select \"Delete Cells\".\n",

Don't copy and paste it, but instead type it - fingers on the keyboard style. Building up your programming chops will come through muscle memory, and tonight will get you started with that.
